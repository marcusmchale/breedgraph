I added "Subject" to formalise descriptions of components of the system under study.
Subject is an expansion of the "entity" property described in the CropOntology.
Subject defines the entity or entities described by a trait.

    - developmental stage details

Most Subject descriptions are well detailed in the Plant Ontology, references to this should be encouraged.
