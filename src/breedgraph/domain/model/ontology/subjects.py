Subject ontology entries for experimental subjects and observation units.
Defines types of subjects that can be observed in breeding experiments.

I added "Subject" to formalise descriptions of components of the system under study.
Subject is an expansion of the "entity" property described in the CropOntology.
Subject defines the entity or entities described by a trait.
    - plant structures and/or environmental components (e.g. rhizosphere)
    - developmental stage details

In considering the Planteome ontologies:

Most Subject descriptions are well detailed in the Plant Ontology, references to this should be encouraged.
